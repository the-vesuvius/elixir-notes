# In Elixir terms, assignment is called binding

# In Elixir, a variable name always starts with a lowercase alphabetic character or an
# underscore. After that, any combination of alphanumeric characters and underscores
# is allowed. The prevalent convention is to use only lowercase ASCII letters, digits, and
# underscore
# Variable names can also end with the question mark (?) or exclamation mark (!)
# characters
a = 1
b = 3

IO.puts a + b
